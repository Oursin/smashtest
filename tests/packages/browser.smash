- [EF]
    - Open REPL
        - Type in "[<EF here>]"

                - Verify that number of elements found is logged to console that's running smashtest



// TODO:
// If not covered by an existing automated test, add these here:

- Running tests in each of the browsers
- Sauce labs
- --selenium-server=<url>
    - Omitted, valid url, bas syntax url, good syntax but unconnectable url, localhost/non-localhost, http/https/no-http
- Test that a browser is killed when a Ctrl + C is done, even mid-navigate (make sure navigate doesn't freeze until the navigate is complete)
- Ctrl + C or X in the REPL will actually kill all browsers
- Standalone selenium vs. selenium grid
